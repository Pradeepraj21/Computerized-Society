The main objective of these website is to minimize the 
manual work and to save papers. As the housing society 
management has to keep track of all details regarding whole

bills ,etc. . So to manage these all data manually it becomes 
difficult and tedious job to human. And at some point of time it 
leads to confusion also. So as to make the work of the society 
easier & faster as possible ,the website is required to handle it.
